### Bill Of Material (BOM) with supported and none supported extensions

For convenience purposes Red Hat build of Quarkus ships with two different BOM files. One that only includes productized extensions and one that contains both productized and community extensions. Please note that the purpose of a Bill of Material is to align versions within a release to avoid misalignment of versions and as such it's not optimal to list supported vs not supported extensions. For a complete list of supported extensions please check the dedicated table on this page.

We only support application build using a BOM, please use one of the following Bill of material:


|GroupID | Extension ID | Explanation |
|---- | ---- | ---- |
|com.redhat.quarkus.platform | quarkus-bom | Supported and community extensions |

#### List of the available platform versions

Red Hat build of Quarkus 2 and later is using a platform concept to align multiple groups of extensions. The list below shows which platform vesions have been released and the members list which additional groups of extensions has been included.

{#include platform-version-list /}

### Supported extensions in Red Hat build of Quarkus {mainVersion}.x
The maven dependency need to use the groupID `io.quarkus`.
We recommend to use the bom file instead of adding the dedicated version for the component.

> NOTE: Some of the extensions were renamed between 3.8.6 and 3.15.1. For technical reasons they appear twice in the table below: under the old name (and marked as supported in 3.8 versions ) and under the new one (and marked as supported in 3.15 versions). Details can be found in release notes for [SmallRye Messaging](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_quarkus/3.15/html-single/release_notes_for_red_hat_build_of_quarkus_3.15/index#ref_rn-qdocs-741-smallrye-reactive-messaging_quarkus-release-notes) and [RESTEasy Reactive](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_quarkus/3.15/html-single/release_notes_for_red_hat_build_of_quarkus_3.15/index#ref_rn-qdocs-740-resteasy-reactive-extensions-renamed-to-quarkus-rest_quarkus-release-notes) extensions.

###### [1] This page lists the status of different extensions from a maturity perspective and does not define what is included in different product subscriptions. This page indicates which extension is considered stable enough to be fully supported, etc., but it does not list what product subscriptions are required to be entitled to. For example, a Red Hat Runtimes subscription or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription does not include integration extensions like Apache Camel and Apache CXF. To get entitlement for Camel and CXF requires a Red Hat Application Foundations (or similar) subscription. # \{#fnote1\}
